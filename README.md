# 🔐 Coding Theory 🔐

This repository contains solutions for my Coding Theory university course assignment.

There are implementations for
- Exponentiation by squaring
- Modular exponentiation by squaring
- Miller–Rabin primality test
- Finding modular inverses using the extended Euclidean algorithm
- RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption
- Calculating Jacobi symbols
- Solovay–Strassen primality test
- Fermat factorization
- GCD using the Euclidean algorithm
- Pollard's rho algorithm for factorization
